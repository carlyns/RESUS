<h1>About</h1>
<div>

	<h2>Social Change as a Passion</h2>
		<p>My name is Carlyn So, and I love to run experiments, using tools from service design, product management, and systems thinking.  RESUS is a sandbox of my experiments dedicated to social change.</p>
		<p>These experiments are all self-initiated and done in my spare time. For projects that build momentum, I collaborate with others.   Social impact has been a common thread in many positions I've held.  </p>

		<p>Through my diverse background, which started in architecture and urban planning, I've picked up technical skills such as web design and management as well as valuable customer service skills.  I'm fortunate to have the chance to apply all of these holistically to these side projects.</p>

	<h3>Need help with your experiment?</h3>
	<p>I'd love to help you think through your idea, strategy, or program.  This is not a paid service - I just seriously enjoy putting projects through this process.  Feel free to <a href="mailto:info@RESUSstudio.com" target="_blank">shoot me an email</a>!  </p>

	<h2>What's your role in Social Change? </h2>
	<p>There's still so much to learn in these early years of social change.  I believe it takes all kinds to make the world go 'round. Everyone - from working in cubicles to working in factories - plays an important role, even if it's a stepping stone to something else. </p>
	<p>The types of changemakers identified by the <a href="https://youtu.be/DZUN6gQhfvM" target="_blank">Story of Change</a> are quite accurate.  I also created this version:</p>

	<div class="grid4">
			<img src="imgs/change-builder.jpg" alt="builder icon">
		<h3>BUILDER: </h3>You are a maker. You need to create. Web developers, database developers, furniture designers, graphic designers, craftsman and tinkerers can help us with building prototypes, apps, meaningful databases, branding campaigns, and accessible and valuable tools.
	</div>

	<div class="grid4">
			<img src="imgs/change-thinker.jpg" alt="thinker icon">
		<h3>THINKER: </h3>You question everything. You love to sort things out and figure out people. Passionate individuals, office workers, strategists, project managers, artists, students, parents - anyone! You can all help us bring fresh ideas to the table because more perspectives mean a more comprehensive solution.
	</div>

	<div class="grid4">
			<img src="imgs/change-investigator.jpg" alt="investigator icon">
		<h3>investigator: </h3>You want to understand existing conditions. You might be a data scientist, academic, student, or policy analyst. You can help identify what's broken or perverse about systems to narrow down our solutions. You identify what information should be collected and suggest how to present it in an accessible, meaningful way.
	</div>

	<div class="grid4">
			<img src="imgs/change-communicator.jpg" alt="communicator icon">
		<h3>communicator: </h3>You can send a message in a unique way, grab attention, and figure out what really resonates with people. You might be a current or aspiring writer, journalist, blogger, theater major, public speaker, musician, or other fearless type.
	</div>

	<div class="grid4">
			<img src="imgs/change-networker.jpg" alt="networker icon">
		<h3>networker: </h3>You know everyone. You connect people to each other everday and you love doing it. People collaborate because of you. You are a matchmaker for change. Bringing two like minds together brings you pure joy.
	</div>

	<div class="grid4">
			<img src="imgs/change-resister.jpg" alt="resister icon">
		<h3>resister: </h3>Acting quickly and directly with people is when you feel like you're getting the most done. You might be an activist or community organizer at heart. Don't think about it too much ... "just do it" is your motto. Who cares about anyone standing in your way.
