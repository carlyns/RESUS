      <ul>
        <li>A home should be a haven, not a place you settle on.</li>
        <li>A home should be part of the community, not a profit for a developer.</li>
        <li>A home should be handcrafted, not an afterthought. </li>
        <li>You should be surrounded by people you can count on, not neighbors you’re stuck with.</li>
        <li>Housing should be controlled by residents, not banks.</li>
        <li>A home should be a lifestyle investment first; a financial investment second, if at all. </li>
        <li>The two dominant options (renting and owning) are addressing none of the above.</li>

        <!-- on smaller screens, show Read More toggle. -->

        <p class="col-lg-4 font-weight-light">Option A.  <span class="h6 border-light mb-3">Your group could form a Nonprofit Corporation</span>.  The corporation (a cooperative) holds the title, but each member has a vote and a right to occupy a unit.  This popular structure has been used for a wide range of properties - from market-rate high-rise units to scattered-site single family homes.  Having a formal decision-making system in place is convenient when managing something as important as property ownership. </p>
        <p class="col-lg-4 font-weight-light">Option B.  <span class="h6">Your group could setup Tenants in Common.</span>  Members could have equal or unequal ownership stakes in the property, but you're still all on the title together.  Making group decisions is less formal.  If you decide to move, you still hold title.  But upon death, whomever you designate in your will takes over ownership of your stake.  This option is popular if your group believes units with varying sizes or amenities should be valued differently.</p>
        <p class="col-lg-4 font-weight-light">Option C.  <span class="h6">Your group could setup Joint Tenancy.</span>  Members all hold title and your ownership stakes are all equal.  If you decide to move, you still hold title.  But upon death, the other tenants will divvy up your stake equally - it doesn't get passed on to your heirs. This structure is appropriate if you'd rather not burden your group with dealing with a new random neighbor.</p>

      <h2 class="border-bottom-brand">Limited Equity  <span class="text-brand-accent">  The Key to Community Benefits</span></h2><!-- on small screens, hide this span element -->
      <p class="text-muted">"Going in on property with friends or family sounds like a great idea! <span class="text-brand-accent">But what about benefitting the community?</span>"</p>
      <p>Consider the limited equity model - an existing framework that guarantees long-term investment in the community.  </p><!-- on small screens, hide this paragrah -->
      <p>Limiting equity means capping the value of a property.  The cap is decided by the residents.</p><!-- on small screens, hide this paragrah -->
      <p>Let's say your unit is "worth" $80K and your group sets a cap at $150K.  If in 10 years the market value increases to $500K, your unit can't be sold for more than $150K.  </p><!-- on small screens, hide this paragrah -->
      <p>It incentivizes residents to stick around instead of using it as a revenue generator.  It essentially removes the property from the speculative real-estate market.  </p>

      <!-- add Learn More toggle -->

      <!-- on all screens, show content below only when Learn More link is clicked  -->
      <p>If a resident does have to move on, it still allows residents to make a fair return on investment.  Very often the cap is set to increase very slightly over time.  So if another family wants to move in after 5 years, the most the unit can sell for might be $81K.  This way the units also remain affordable even for the next members (not exclusive to the highest bidder).  </p>
      <p>There are many variations on limited equity that can be custom-designed for each group.  It is commonly coupled with the cooperative legal structure, but has been used with joint tenancy and even condominiums in the past.  </p>
      <p>We're encouraging groups to consider the Limited Equity model because it disallows developers to profit absurdly if the neighborhood happens to gentrify.  It secures the fate of families who are simply looking for stable places to live and contribute, not cash in. </p>
      <p>We'll post more information about this model soon. For now, email us or create a profile expressing your interest in this model. </p>
