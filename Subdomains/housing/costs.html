      <h2 class="display-4">Hypothetical 6-Unit Building</h2>
      <p>Be sure to consider both <a href="#initialcosts">Initial</a> and <a href="#ongoingcosts">Ongoing</a> Costs!  </p>

      <h3 class="border-bottom-brand section-mt" id="initialcosts">What are the INITIAL costs?</h3>
      <p>Initial costs include: property acquisition, repairs/rehab, contingency, apprasal, survey, inspections fees, legal fees, design fees, loan fees, title fees, transfer taxes, and reserves for capital or lease up.</p>
      <h4>For this hypothetical example, we'll say the Total Project Costs = $440K</h4>
      <p>Groups often spread the total project costs across the units to derive their full unit values or "unit shares." </p>

      <img src="assets/imgs/costs-building.png" alt="This example proposes different values of the units based on unit size." class="img-fluid">
      <p>In this case of 4 two-bedroom units and 2 one-bedroom units, let's say the group decided that the two-bedroom units have a share value of $80K and the one-bedroom units have a share value of $60K. (or "unit prices")</p>
      <p>$80K + $60K + $80K + $80K + $60K + $80K = $440K</p>
      <p>Can your group afford to pay for this building in cash?  Well, more power to ya!  We're assuming that most groups can only pay a portion up front and will finance the remainder.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Some group members can "put down" more upfront, or Member Equity:</p>

      <img src="assets/imgs/costs-shares.png" alt="Member 1 puts down $10K of $80k.  Member 2 puts down $5K of $60K.  Member 3 putds down $30K of $80K.  Member 4 puts down $10K of $80K.  Member 5 puts down $30K of $80K.  The last unit is an unoccupied 1 bedroom so $0K of $60K is put down." class="img-fluid">
      <p>$10K + $5K + $30K + $10K + $0K + $30K</p>
      <p>= $85K</p>
      <p>= your Group Equity (think of it as a collective down payment)</p>
      <p>This means your group is putting down 19% of $440K total.</p>
      <hr>
      <h4>Your group still needs to finance $355k somehow!  </h4>
      <p>So even though these are initial costs, your group and its members will likely be paying these over time.</p>
      <p>This usually means your monthly fee will include a contribution to the group loan. </p>

      <h3 class="border-bottom-brand section-mt" id="ongoingcosts">What are the ONGOING costs?</h3>
      <p>The group shares these ongoing costs.</p>
      <img src="assets/imgs/costs-ongoing.png" alt="They include: property taxes, insurance, water, other utilities/services, supplies/misc, minor repairs/maintenance, reserve for emergencies/improvements, and continuing eduation." class="img-fluid">
      <p>Groups can decide whether dividing these costs should reflect unit sizes or variations in amenities.  There is no standard - it's up to your group!  </p>
      <p>Groups should also consider potential increases in costs due to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>inflation</li>
        <li>fluctuating property tax rates</li>
        <li>fluctuating utility costs</li>
        <li>fluctuating insurance rates</li>
        <li>etc</li>
      </ul>

          <p>Why are we doing this?  </p>

          <p>We are not pleased with the two dominant options for housing in America: renting and owning ... and we think a lot of people would agree. We believe there is room for a third option.</p>
          <p>We've been working on housing initiatives for a while, and we genuinely think Shared Equity / Property Ownership has potential to provide decent, affordable housing for all.</p>
          <p>This was built and compiled by Carlyn So, with the help of a few key advisors.  </p>
