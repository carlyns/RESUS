      <p>Be sure to consider both <a href="#initialcosts">Initial</a> and <a href="#ongoingcosts">Ongoing</a> Costs!  </p>

      <h3 class="border-bottom-brand section-mt" id="initialcosts">What are the INITIAL costs?</h3>
      <h5>Total Project Costs = $440K</h5>
      <p>This includes: property acquisition, repairs/rehab, contingency, apprasal, survey, inspections fees, legal fees, design fees, loan fees, title fees, transfer taxes, and reserves for capital or lease up.</p>

      <img src="assets/imgs/place1.png" alt="Let's say there are four 2 bedroom units and two 1 bedroom units for a total of six units in this building.  This example considers the different values of the units based on unit size.  2 bedroom units have a share value of $80K and 1 bedroom units have a share value of $60K.">

      <hr>
      <p>Some group members can put down more upfront:</p>

      <img src="assets/imgs/place2.png" alt="Member 1 puts down $10K of $80k.  Member 2 puts down $5K of $60K.  Member 3 putds down $35K of $80K.  Member 4 puts down $10K of $80K.  Member 5 puts down $25K of $80K.  The last unit is an unoccupied 1 bedroom so $0K of $60K is put down.">
      <p>$10K + $5K + $35K + $10K + $0K + $25K</p>
      <p>= $85K</p>
      <p>= your collective down payment</p>
      <p>This means your group is putting down 19% of $440K total.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Your group still needs to finance $355k somehow!</p>

      <h3 class="border-bottom-brand section-mt" id="ongoingcosts">What are the ONGOING costs?</h3>
      <p>The group shares these ongoing costs.</p>
      <img src="assets/imgs/place3.png" alt="They include: property taxes, insurance, water, other utilities/services, supplies/misc, minor repairs/maintenance, reserve for emergencies/improvements, and continuing eduation.">
      <p>Groups can decide whether dividing these costs should reflect unit sizes or variations in amenities.  There is no standard - it's up to your group!  </p>
      <p>Groups should also consider potential increases in costs due to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>inflation</li>
        <li>fluctuating property tax rates</li>
        <li>fluctuating utility costs</li>
        <li>fluctuating insurance rates</li>
        <li>etc</li>

          <p>Why are we doing this?  </p>

          <p>We are not pleased with the two dominant options for housing in America: renting and owning ... and we think a lot of people would agree. We believe there is room for a third option.</p>
          <p>We've been working on housing initiatives for a while, and we genuinely think Shared Equity / Property Ownership has potential to provide decent, affordable housing for all.</p>
          <p>This was built and compiled by Carlyn So, with the help of a few key advisors.  </p>
