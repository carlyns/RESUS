  <h2>Summary</h2> <p>This oral history project is focused on a group of South Asians who lived in Illinois before the major wave of Asian
  immigration began in 1965. They are a little known community of
  pioneers who have made significant contributions to the building of
  America but whose story has never been told. They are a highly
  educated articulate group, eager to tell their stories, as seen in the interviews conducted for this project. </p>
  <p>Thirty-three interviews were conducted for this project under the supervision of qualified researchers. Many of the interviews were conducted by relatives of the interviewees themselves, usually members of the younger generation. This report presents an analysis of those interviews.</p> <p> A methodology section describes how the project was conducted, using community events to seek input from community members and elicit the involvement of volunteers, donors, and students from area universities. </p>
  <p>The analysis is divided into the following sections: </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">General Profile of Immigrant Interviewees</a> describes the demographics of this group.</li>
    <li><a href="#">Origins</a> traces the diverse backgrounds of the immigrants before they came to the U.S. </li>
    <li><a href="#">Coming to Illinois</a> identifies what drew the immigrants to Illinois, why they came, and why they decided to stay. </li>
    <li><a href="#">The Journey</a> describes their arduous travel by boat in the days before commercial jets. </li>
    <li><a href="#">The Early Days</a> reveals what it was like to be away from home, what measures the immigrants took to deal with their loneliness, and who were the people who helped them overcome their difficulties.</li>
    <li><a href="#">Looking for a Place to Stay</a> places the Indians in turbulent times, squarely in the middle of the civil
    rights era, when they encountered issues of racism and prejudice, yet
    found ways to cope with them.  </li>
    <li><a href="#">Proud of their Achievements</a> showcases the contributions they made to their new homeland.  </li>
    <li><a href="#">Conclusion</a> is an attempt to summarize
    the significance of their immigrant  experience.</li>

  <h2><a name="scope"></a>Scope</h2> <p>The project undertook to collect at least 25 oral
  histories of South Asians who came to Illinois between 1945 and 1965.
  The interviews were to be recorded, transcribed, analyzed, and
  prepared for publication and archiving. </p> <p>The project also
  undertook to engage community members and the youth, both South Asians
  and non-South Asians, in the collection and interpretation of the
  data.    </p> <p>This report will describe the process by which the
  above-mentioned objectives were accomplished. It will also present a
  summary analysis of the oral histories and show how they contribute to
  an understanding of immigration history. </p>
  <p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p>

  <h2><a name="methodology"></a>Methodology</h2>
  <p>Since the project called for the continued participation of
  community members, all community events (held in January, February,
  June and August, 2006) were used as opportunities for obtaining
  feedback, recruiting volunteers and donors, publicizing the project,
  and giving individuals a chance to share their stories. Community
  events thus became part of the process for furthering the research.
  </p> <p>The project was announced to the public via a news release in
  December 2005, and a letter to community members inviting them to a
  kick-off event on January 28th at the Indo-American Center in Chicago.
  At the event, participants gave their input on the draft oral history
  questionnaires, and referred new names for interviewing. Family
  members and student volunteers willing to conduct interviews were
  identified, and the interviewing process began, using the revised
  questionnaire. (<a href="#">Appendix 1</a>.) </p> <p>A second
  community event was held on February 25 in Downers Grove, hosted by
  two major donors. Participants identified more potential interviewees
  and volunteers, and gave suggestions on how to increase support and
  outreach. </p> <p>The third major community event, held on June 19 in
  Oakbrook, was both a fundraiser and an opportunity for interviewers of
  the younger generation to talk about what they got out of the
  interview process. Personal stories from interviewers and interviewees
  touched the audience, inspiring them to give generously to the
  project. </p> <p>Periodic presentations to university audiences
  (University of Illinois at Champagne- Urbana and Loyola University
  students) enabled the recruitment of students for conducting
  interviews and helping with transcription. </p> <p>The final community
  event, held in conjunction with India’s Independence Day observances
  at the Indo American Center on August 12, created historic connections
  for the pioneers and other immigrants. Activities, such as
  presentations by children of immigrants who interviewed their parents
  for the project, and creation of a timeline that connected immigrant
  arrival dates to historic events, made the oral histories come alive
  for the audience. Stories of isolation and discrimination, struggles
  and triumphs were shared. As one observer remarked, “the stories were
  at once personal and universal.” </p> <p>Instead of the estimated 25,
  the number of oral histories recorded amounted to 33. (A list of the
  29 interviewees whose oral histories have been transcribed so far is
  included as <a href="#">Appendix 2</a>.) Several interviews were videotaped. Twelve,
  or a third of the interviews were conducted by members of the younger
  generation, either relatives or university students. In one
  interesting case, the son who was interviewing the father was himself
  eligible to be interviewed, since he came as a teenage immigrant in
  1963. Even as he was interviewing his Dad, he recounted his own
  experiences as a teenager in the pre-1965 period, thus adding a new
  dimension to the story. </p> <p>Many of the interviewees promised to
  donate memorabilia which included a book in progress about the early
  days, the first suit ever sold by a custom tailor interviewee, old
  passports, tapes of old songs and LP records, newspaper recognitions,
  letters, articles in school papers, and photographs. When archival
  facilities become available in the community, there will be follow up
  with these interviewees to collect the donations. </p> <p>Each one of
  the oral histories is unique and needs to be read in its entirety for
  the full flavor of the personal life that unfolds. But collectively,
  these oral histories also represent the experience of a group. So what
  follows is an analysis of the transcripts. It consists of a general
  profile of the interviewees, and a narrative that identifies some
  broad patterns. Woven throughout the narrative are quotations that
  capture the immediacy of the experience in the immigrants’ own
  words.</p> <p> <a href="#">Appendix 3</a> is the complete, unedited
  transcription of one interview, provided as a sample. It captures the
  full range of emotions that both father and son experienced as they
  relived their past. </p> <p>The interviewees ranged in age from their
  mid-sixties to late seventies (born between 1927 and 1941). One person
  who came as a teenager was born in 1948. </p> <p>Most of the
  interviewees came between 1952 and 1965, with the exception of one who
  arrived in 1945. This meant that most were in their early twenties
  when they arrived.    </p> <p>They acquired their green cards or
  permanent resident status in the mid 1960s when it became possible to
  do so. Most became US citizens soon thereafter, in the early 1970s,
  after waiting for the mandatory period. Only three of the interviewees
  retained their Indian citizenship until later. Two of them decided
  post 9/11 that it was safer to become US citizens while the third one,
  a woman, is seriously considering acquiring US citizenship now that
  she is collecting Social Security y (I feel I “owe America”) and it is
  now possible to have dual citizenship in India. </p> <p>13 were family
  interviews, which means both husband and wife were included in the
  same interview. </p> <p>The number of women included in the interviews
  was 18. Five of the interviews were with women alone, and three of
  them came as single women to the US.</p> <p> There was broad religious
  and linguistic representation in the group. The religious breakdown of
  the interviewees is as follows: 13 Hindu, 7 Catholic, 6 Muslim, 2
  Jain, and 1 Parsi.</p> <p>The native languages spoken by the
  interviewees included Hindi, Malayalam, Gujarati, Tamil, Sindhi, Urdu,
  Kannada, and Konkani. All of them spoke English, indeed most were
  fluent in English even before they came to the US, thanks to their
  high level of education in India. </p>
  <p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p>
  <h2><a name="origins"></a>Origins</h2> <p>Most came
  directly from India, though many were born and had lived during
  childhood in pre-partition days in what is now Pakistan. One person
  recounted the trauma of fleeing from Pakistan, amidst the carnage of
  Partition in 1947. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Pitaji used to work for
  a revolutionary Gandhi and Nehru. He came to our house running. “Leave
  in 5 minutes, they’re a mob of Muslims who are coming to our house, in
  that direction ... they’re killing everybody inside, all the Hindus.” So
  we have 5 minutes to escape, whatever jewelry my mother could gather. I
  was down with a typhoid fever, so my brother Jagdish picked me up. We
  had a 1936 Chevrolet. And we jumped into the car, and all kind of people
  who climbed on top of the car to escape. And we had 30 people on top of
  the car. There were dead bodies all over. It was kind of
  sad.</blockquote>


  <p>Many were from well-to-do families, though a few of the families
  had a more modest background. </p>


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote> It was a well-to-do
  family that I come from. And there was nothing that I couldn’t hope or
  wish or desire that was not in my hands immediately. My father had lot
  of business with Japan and France and in our home, at lot of foreigners
  came. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My parents were simple
  farmers. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We were a middle
  class family, in Bangalore, India. L5e in a modest house...just
   enough to survive. We were a very large family. It was an urban life,
  but with exposre to village because my mother was born in a village
  and her parents were in a small town. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I grew up in a rural
  environment. My father was a landlord. Lots of people surrounding our
  area depended (on us) for their livelihood, for jobs, they used to
  come to our place and used to work in our farms.</blockquote>

  <p>One immigrant came from Hong Kong, another from East Africa. </p>
  <p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p>


  <h2><a name="comingtoil"></a>Coming to Illinois </h2> <p>Almost all (except one) had had at
  least an undergraduate education in India. Most came on student visas,
  with scholarships to pursue graduate studies in engineering. The
  universities that received the Indian students were Loyola University,
  University of Illinois at Chicago, DePaul University, and University
  of Chicago. One immigrant came on a business visa. Some others studied
  medicine or sociology or literature. Many of them, after pursuing
  brief engineering careers on training visas, moved on to other fields
  as academics or businessmen. Among the interesting career paths chosen
  by immigrants were: custom tailor, librarian, social worker, and real
  estate broker. </p> <p>They chose Illinois because they had contacts
  here. Someone knew a Jesuit priest at Loyola, others had relatives,
  yet others came because this is where they were offered scholarships
  or found jobs. The very first arrivals attracted others that followed
  and gave them a place to stay or supported them in some other way.
  </p> <p>The intention for most of these early arrivals was to study,
  work for a few years on a training visa, and then return to India for
  good. Immigration was not an option for them at that time since it was
  not until 1965 that the laws were relaxed to allow them to stay. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote> I came here to pursue
  a dream. I could only come as a student to pursue studies. I was
  resigned to going back since there were no immigration
  quotas.</blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote> I had full intentions
  of going back to India after school. I applied to the University of
  Illinois because I had an aunt in Chicago. I decided to stay after
  meeting (my American wife) and graduating and getting a good
  job.</blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I thought I’d come to
  America, have fun getting my Ph.D. and return after a long vacation.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I was very much
  encouraged by the employment level I received from Johnson controls.
  That was to train me and send me back to India after my training. That
  fulfilled my desire to go back to India, so I was very enthusiastic
  about the whole thing. </blockquote> <p>Still, there were some among
  them who were determined to make the United States their permanent home,
  especially those who had children and wanted to give them a brighter
  future. </p>


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I got a scholarship at
  DePaul University. I planned to go back after studies. I then thought of
  bringing over my wife so she could also see this beautiful country. The
  kids came in 1967 and then 1968. They were in gifted programs, doing
  very well in schools. They wouldn’t get this kind of opportunity in
  India, so I decided to stay for the kids’ education. That is the main
  reason. </blockquote> <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I came to improve quality of life for me and my children. I planned to
  stay. I didn’t want to go back. </blockquote> <div
  class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Because at that time, our relatives and friends think I am kind of crazy. Because I was already well-established in the seminary high school as a teacher.....I convinced (my wife’s brother.) I am not going kind of fancy dreaming,
  but this is good for my children, for their future, for my family.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Several did return to India after their studies, took up jobs there,
  but came back to the U.S. They were frustrated in their jobs in India,
  and got new opportunities to return to the States, this time with a
  green card, or the promise of one. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I returned to India and
  wanted to do poultry farming but my dad (who was a doctor) wouldn’t
  support it, so I returned to the States. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My visa expired and I
  had to go back to India. I was lucky to get a job at a post-graduate
  institution in Chandigarh. But I was not satisfied ... I jumped at the
  first chance to return to the US. </blockquote>


  <p>For the single women, coming to the US sometimes meant overcoming the
  fears and resistance of family members and following their ambitions.
  </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My mother didn't like
  the idea, didn't think I could manage on my own. I wanted to get
  away...from the tension in the family. I don't know why, but I wasn't
  content. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Being a primary school
  teacher (in India) was just not good enough for me. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I think that everybody
  in our immediate family, and also some of ouracquaintances and friends,
  all thought my parents were very foolish, sending off a single girl to
  the United States, because they just felt I should be marrie. ... but
  my parents were forward looking. They thought it was important for us to
  study, to do what we wanted to do. </blockquote>

  <p> And then there are those stories that defy categorization....


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>When I came to Chicago,
  I remember my very first evening when I stayed at the Sheraton on
  Michigan Avenue. The next day I was all dressed up (in a suit and tie)
  and went down to the restaurant for breakfast. When I came down, a hand
  came forward "Mayor Daley, welcome to Chicago." I didn't know what to
  say. This could never happen to me in any other place. So then I
  decided, Chicago is my town.</blockquote>


  <p>They embarked on their journey, their heads filled with images of
  America from the movies or history books.    </p>


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My idea of America at
  that time was Doris Day and Rock Hudson and Cary Grant. </blockquote>
  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I thought of America as
  Utopia. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I thought I would have
  enough money and life would be easy. I wouldn't have to work too hard. I
  didn't expect I would have to work and study at the same time.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>
  <p>I had studied American
    history, so I had book information. Chicago was the beef capital,
    Detroit was for cars. </p></blockquote>
  <p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p>



  <h2><a name="journey"></a>The Journey  </h2> <p>Most of the early immigrants came by boat. As
  one of them observed, commercial jets were not common until the early
  1960s. The boat from India (either Cochin or Bombay) came via the Suez
  canal and took 23 to 27 days. Occasionally there were delays and
  multiple stopovers. Some were cargo ships that accommodated only a few
  passengers. Sometimes they traveled with a large group of students--as
  many as 60—at other times, an immigrant would be the lone Asian on
  board. The boats stopped in Southampton, England before proceeding to
  New York. One immigrant who came from Hong Kong traveled via Honolulu.
  </p>


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>It took 26 days from
  Cochin to New York with stops in Aden and Italy...came with a group of
  Malayalis with scholarships to different places. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I journeyed by boat to
  Marseilles, then overland to Paris, Dover, Southampton, London—8 or 9
  days wait and on to New York in a luxury liner. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I came by boat to New York—23-24 days. I had some friends on the ship who helped me get on the
  bus. I felt excited and confused. </blockquote>

  </div>



  <div class="liberty">
  We worked hard, gave our heart and soul. We had something to do with the prosperity that America saw.
   </div>



  <div class="container">

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I was on a cargo ship
  for 27 days with one Punjabi and one Tamilian. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I came by ship from
  Cochin to London, from London I also came by ship on Queen Elizabeth to
  New York. I was very excited before I landed. We saw the liberty statue
  and we had heard about it on the ship. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I came alone. I was the
  only Asian in that ship which was an American ship. It was a
  cargo-cum-passenger ship. And I was very lonely in that ship. But every
  once in a while, a couple, two or three co-passengers , they would say
  Hello to me, and you know, talk to me. Had a lot of time. I would read.
  It took 31 days for me to get here. Normally it takes only 26 days. Five
  days we spent in Port Suez because we had an accident. </blockquote>

  <p>The journey from New York to Chicago was invariably by Greyhound.
  Such a long bus ride was a novelty for the Indians and by the time they
  arrived in Chicago, many had used up a major chunk of their meager
  finances allotted by the government—ranging from $100 to $400. And they
  learned lessons along the way. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I carried my own steel
  trunk on my head. So I learned, as soon as possible, not to rely on
  anybody. Not very many people here available at low pay, so you have to
  be self-reliant. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>
    <p>In some of the states
      we passed, we were shocked to see restrooms that said, "Whites only."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
    <p><a href="#top">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p>

  <h2><a name="earlydays"></a>The early days </h2> <p>The Americans whom the Indians encountered
  when they first came had very little knowledge of India. They were
  friendly for the most part, and curious. Many had stereotypical images
  of India as a place with wild animals and no electricity. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>People were not aware
  where India was on the map. They had never seen an Indian before. They
  were fascinated by the way I spoke British English. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>They asked if India was
  in Africa. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We stood out on campus
  in our saris. There were very few Indian ladies, so we were sought
  after. People were attracted by my long hair. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Some people thought we
  were Spanish. They had no clue what we were. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Americans were very
  kind but I found them a bit impersonal. Students were very competitive,
  not unfriendly but busy doing their own thing. I was advised by a priest
  that I would be better off wearing a sari and be seen as an Indian than
  try to wear western clothes and be taken for a black. </blockquote>


  <p>The initial experience for most Indians was an overwhelming feeling
  of isolation and homesickness, especially for those who had left behind
  their wives and children. There were financial hardships for students,
  and very few Indians with whom they could share their troubles. </p>


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I lost my Dad and cried
  myself to sleep for over a year. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>It was hard to leave
  behind my wife, two children and one on the way ...We longed to see the
  children and wrote letters every week. It was a psychological not a
  physical hardship. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We couldn't even call
  home it was so expensive. We put our voices on tape and sent them back
  and forth. We missed not being able to share our children with
  grandparents. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>The hardest part was
  being a wife without the support of extended family. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>There were no Indians
  here. I didn't know anybody, any Indian, in Chicago ... Slowly other
  Indians started coming in, six months later, some more students came and
  I happened to know them. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Being a first time
  mother was totally frightening. I felt very lonely. Whenever my Mom or
  Dad would call (from India) I would burst into tears. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>You missed home-cooked
  food, your own people. Nobody helped you with anything. It was most
  frustrating. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I missed going to an
  Indian temple, no Indian food, no Indian restaurant. I used to eat beans
  and rice in Mexican restaurants and dream that I was eating "dal-
  chawal" </blockquote>

 <div class="photo">

  <p>Photo Caption and Credit.</p>
 </div>


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Whenever (my wife)
  would cook dal and sabzi and all that, I would go to the pizza place and
  ask them to give me a pizza without anything on top of it. And they were
  baffled. "Why would you like this?" They didn't realize what we were
  doing, using it just like naan or roti. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>As foreign students, we
  couldn't afford to flunk a course, we would lose our student status and
  face deportation. We got jobs easily but they would terminate us
  whenever there was a financial crisis so we had to keep looking for new
  jobs. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>The hardest part was
  not having enough time to study and work. Not enough money.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>The weather was simply
  horrible! </blockquote>


  <p>But Americans also befriended the Indians. Through the YMCA and
  Foreign Students Associations, Indians were invited by host families to
  stay with them over long holiday weekends or share a special meal for
  Thanksgiving or Christmas. Some of those early contacts led to lasting
  friendships. Almost every interviewee could recall the names of
  professors, employers, neighbors and others who provided them valuable
  support. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>The people I worked for
  as a student were very supportive. They became my friends. One of them
  gave me $50,000 for a down payment when I went into real estate. Bankers
  helped us. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Our professors were so nice to us,
  they'd invite us for dinners and Thanksgiving.</blockquote>


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Monsignor befriended
  me. His secretaries bought me clothes, taught me everything.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Two people who made a
  strong impression were Saul Bellow and Richard Stern, both novelists.
  They saw me as a gifted writer and rescued me from the anthropological
  card catalog... </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>People at Barker
  Chemical Company (where my husband worked) were very kind to me. We got
  support from our neighbors who played with our kids. One of them even
  gave my daughter free piano lesson because she had long fingers...
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>All the engineers, all
  the secretaries, the management ... they were very helpful getting them
  (my family) here. Even the tickets were purchased by the staff for them
  to come here. When they arrived at the airport, I had twenty people with
  me from the staff to receive them at the airport. Not only that, the
  company employees decorated my apartment, provided everything for their
  comfort, bought us a television set, some furniture and some clothing
  for them. And one of them ... he came to our house to visit my children
  with four bags of toys. </blockquote>

  <p>But others remember being
  totally self-reliant. </p>

  <h2><a name="makingaliving"></a>Making a Living</h2>

  <p>At first, many of the students were prohibited from working, but at
  least one immigrant was not afraid to confront the authorities and
  demand permission to work. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I went to the immigration officer and told him, “You gave me
  permission and visa to come here. I have $100. You think I can live on
  $100? I’m paying $30 for rent. So you should give me work permission.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>He did get permission. Others found some way to get
  part-time jobs so they could support themselves. These were usually jobs
  in retail or in the factory, making anywhere from a dollar to $2.50 an
  hour. The jobs they took included working in a cafeteria, as a shipping
  clerk, wiring and soldering, front desk in a hotel, chef in a cafeteria,
  and nursing assistant. Once they graduated, most got jobs in their
  professional field and started making good money. A few stayed on in
  their first jobs until retirement. Others faced hurdles or encountered
  the glass ceiling. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I got an offer to work full time for $9,500 a year, with a
  raise every year. I worked for 25 years with the company and traveled
  worldwide. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My boss was excellent, he gave me promotions and raises. I
  ended up as VP and Chief engineer. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My business (making custom made suits) thrived in Chicago,
  because of the extreme weather. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I couldn’t get an engineering job because Indians had a
  bad reputation of working for a few months and leaving. At my consulting
  work, if I criticized them, they said, “You foreigners tell us how to do
  things?” But my boss was supportive. He said, “Hey, he’s come to help
  us. We called him.” </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My first job as a student was in a factory. In my first
  engineering job, people were good to me but my accent was a problem.
  Working class Americans weren’t as good to me. </blockquote>

  <p>According to the American wife of one Indian immigrant, </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>He worked for 12 years as a Project engineer and realized
  it was a dead end job. He would get to a certain point and would never
  be promoted above it. So we bought buildings...and found we could make
  much more money managing that than working a 40-hour week.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I found it very hard to find jobs because of
  discrimination. Impression I got was all bank jobs were reserved for
  whites. People were always talking about the shortage of labor but when
  you went for a job or an apartment, that was taken or filled.
  </blockquote>



  <p>Generally, interviewees said that they were treated fairly at work,
  and given fair wages. Some suspected that they and their Indian friends
  whom they were recommending were being hired because they worked hard
  for low wages, but they were prepared to overlook it because these were
  part-time jobs, and they were happy to get the work as students. The
  women did observe that they found it hard to get better paying jobs or
  were hindered in their career path. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I faced career hardships as a faculty wife and teacher. My
  husband’s career rose. I made moves as his camp follower ... always over
  or under-qualified for jobs ... could not work outside the
  house ... husband’s emotional expectation was traditional. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I observed that people with light-complexion from India
  had better chance. </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="placetostay"></a>Looking for a place to stay </h2>

  <p>As students, the early Indian immigrants had housing provided for
  them, either in the dorm or in International House at the University of
  Chicago. When they moved out, either because they wanted to cook their
  own food or found it cheaper, they got together with other Indians and
  went apartment hunting. It was here that they had their first encounter
  with discriminatory practices that were institutionalized in the Chicago
  of the 1950 and 1960s. Even those who had never felt discriminated
  against in their jobs, experienced discrimination in housing, and those
  who had not experienced it themselves could easily remember hearing
  about the experiences of others. </p>

  <p>For some Indians who were unaware of racism in the United States,
  this came as a shock. Some saw this as a problem between blacks and
  whites, and felt they were somehow caught in the middle. Even when they
  became targets of discrimination, they could find it in their hearts to
  move on and not become angry or embittered. This may no doubt be due to
  the feeling that this is not necessarily “their” problem, but it could
  also be a simple strategy for survival. Many respondents felt that this
  was a problem that existed largely in the south, and this was reinforced
  for them when they went traveling by road in the southern states. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I had a hard time finding a place (in Aurora) because when
  I went to look at a place, people look at my face and tell me place was
  already rented ... I think people thought I was black or Spanish or God
  knows what they were thinking. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>In Louisiana, when I was looking for my first place, one
  guy asked, “Don’t Indians have a mixture of Negro and Chinese blood?”
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>It was hard to find a house in a purely white
  neighborhood. When you call for an appointment, they say, Yes, you can
  come over, but when you go there, “I’m sorry, it’s just rented.”
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We were perceived not at par with American white people.
  Not exactly like black people, but in between. We are not first class,
  we are second class, blacks are third class. ... I took a black friend
  when I was invited to a white family in Oak Park. He had never been in a
  white person’s house. He was all excited. “Gee, they are very nice.”
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>One of my fellow students from the south (of India) very
  dark, in Tulsa, was asked to sit in the back of the bus. I had to
  convince the bus driver he was not black. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My brother came to America and was moving into his
  apartment. And I had checked out that there is availability, etc. And he
  told me there is no vacancy. And so he was really upset and he told me
  you must call and find out if it’s really vacant. And I called and it
  was vacant. This was a really white suburb in South Holland.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>This one gentleman was returning to Florida and he sold
  his home to a black person. Overnight, the whole neighborhood turned
  black. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>The real estate agent wouldn’t show me the house that I
  liked in a good neighborhood because he thought his clients in the area
  may object. My guess is that that was the reason. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My application (for an apartment on Michigan Avenue) was
  rejected even though I had $50,000 in the bank. A good friend, an
  attorney, called them and they gave me the place. Maybe he suggested a
  lawsuit. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>At the YMCA, when I went down for breakfast, they wouldn’t
  serve me. “Do you mind if we serve in your room?” I knew why. They
  didn’t want a colored person sitting in their cafeteria. Those kinds of
  experiences, I took with a grain of salt ...The illiterate treated us
  differently from the literate. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div>
  <blockquote>I only came to know there was so much prejudice and
  discrimination when I was looking for an apartment. This is right near
  Holy Name Cathedral area. Some people would say openly, east of State
  Street non-white people would not be allowed to rent. I was unhappy but
  I accept the reality. When I called for a number west of State Street,
  the landlady asked to come over but when she saw through the glass door
  I was not white she said “No room, no room” and wouldn’t even open the
  door. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>When we took a long trip to Florida, as soon as we crossed
  the border of Virginia and Tennessee, we felt it. There would be a
  Vacancy sign in a motel but when we go there, there would be No Vacancy.
  We felt bad about that so what we started doing...you send the ladies.
  They knew what the sari was, they knew we were not black people, then
  they would give us a room. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>In those days, you would see the lines separating blacks
  and whites going to the bathrooms. We were always on the white side, I
  believe because of the saris, we were never challenged. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I knew people in Crossroads (Student Center) were very
  involved in the civil rights movement. The leader of Crossroads went to
  Selma and marched there. Meetings and some violence associated with
  that. There was SNCC. We noticed that white people were more friendly
  towards us than towards black Americans. They sort of looked down on
  them and felt it was a waste to educate them. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>When we came to the north side (looking for apartments) we

  <h2><a name="proudachievements"></a>Proud of their achievements </h2>

  <p>Despite all the hardships they went through, or perhaps because of
  them, the Indians were very proud of their legacy. Even though they were
  small in number, they felt they had played a key role in building a
  positive image of India and Indians by explaining their culture and
  their homeland to a largely ignorant population of Americans. They also
  felt they had helped their own families and friends by sponsoring and
  supporting new immigrants. Their own loneliness and need for organized
  support had led them to form the first associations in the
  community—religious, professional, and national—which were now a great
  resource for new generations of Indian immigrants. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We set up organizations—cultural, political—and founded
  institutions. Set up the Indian American Forum for Political Education
  and testified before the Senate Committee on Immigration against taking
  away the fifth preference, bringing brothers and sisters. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We started religious groups, built temples and
  restaurants, and today our children don’t miss these things.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We explained India to others, they had preconceived
  notions that India was a jungle, we showed them it was civilized, had
  big cities, good education. </blockquote>


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We worked hard, gave our heart and soul. We had something
  to do with the prosperity that America saw. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We contributed in terms of education—hundreds of thousands
  of professors and teachers and engineers and doctors. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My husband wrote 25 books. I was his first reader and
  helper for 25 years. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>Wherever we worked, we held our heads high. We did not
  beg, nobody gave us a gift. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We created a good impression, so much goodwill. Now people
  assume, if you’re Indian, you’re smart. Because we were all college
  graduates, we established a good reputation. Even if they see a dumb
  Indian, they still think you’re smart. They think Indians pay their
  bills on time, don’t commit crimes, so we deserve credit for that. We
  provided safety net for those who came after-my older and younger
  brothers—being able to sponsor your family and be self-sufficient.
  </blockquote>


  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We started Indian Students Associations. I started NETIP
  (Network of Indian American Professionals) in 1971 in Chicago. Now it
  has 25 chapters, it is international, in Canada and England.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We are good citizens. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We are fully supportive of poorer Indians who are coming
  in, so they get accepted. </blockquote>

  <p>After more than four decades of living in the Chicago area, these
  early immigrants are able to see why they decided to stay and why they
  are still here. They talked about those days and why they were
  meaningful. </p>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>My life is better here than in India. Even though I didn’t
  lack for anything in India. Just being free and independent, but also
  having family here, I don’t think I could have lived here if I were all
  alone. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>It was exciting to see, learn new things, meet new people.
  </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>We had good friends and family, get-togethers. People
  don’t interfere and we don’t have to account to anyone. People mind
  their own business. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>People were very friendly, helpful, lots of things were
  available. Gas, everything was cheap. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>I had freedom. I misused it at times, had no
  responsibilities in my youth. </blockquote>

  <div class="quotemark">&#8220;</div> <blockquote>If you can make it in Chicago, you can make it anywhere.
  We were attacked, terrorized by crime. But it was also exciting, in
  terms of intellectual and cultural ferment. It is a face-to-face society
  still. Unlike New York, in Chicago one could get to be known for who one
  is. In a sense it was the best, and it was the worst. </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2> <p>The telling of these stories was an emotional
  experience for the immigrants, some of whom even broke down as they
  recalled a particularly significant event or moment from their distant
  past. The children who conducted the interviews learned things about
  their parents they never knew while the parents were forced to assess
  and evaluate their own lives for their children. </p>

  <p>What emerges from these oral histories is the portrait of a group of
  adventurous young men and women who set forth on an unknown journey, and
  made good in a strange land. They experienced the isolation and
  alienation that every immigrant goes through, but in even greater
  measure because they were so few in numbers. They created their own
  support systems but also merged into the society in which they lived and
  worked. They developed strategies to cope with discrimination, and used
  available opportunities to find their own best occupations. By choosing
  to stay on in a country to which they had come seeking only higher
  education, they carved their own path to success and permanence in
  America. Yet they stayed in touch their roots, always conscious of their
  role as a pioneering group, as ambassadors for their homeland. </p>

  <p>These stories needed to be told, and told now. Without a historical
  record of this vanguard group, South Asians would be missing a vital
  link to their past, a link that bridges the gap between the gradual
  trickle of Indians who came soon after WWII and the surge of immigrants
  after 1965. </p>
