      <h2>An Equity Problem</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="phasecontent">
      <!-- include context, don't suggest a solution, include a metric to improve -->
      <p>Countless initiatives address food justice in low-income areas. At the same time, the good food and local food movements are thriving in wealthier neighborhoods. The high operational costs that local farmers face drive the high prices at grocery stores that low-income families cannot afford, often at inaccessible locations.  <span style="font-weight: 800;">How might we streamline processes for local farmers to capture the demand for good food from underserved neighborhoods?</span></p>

        <h2>Proposal</h2>
      </div>

    <div class="phasecontent">

      <p>This project aggregates demand for locally-sourced, high-quality groceries.</p>
      <p>On the supply side, residents input information, knowing the information will come back to benefit them directly.</p>
      <p>On the demand side, local suppliers and farmers can pinpoint volume data to expand their business and distribution. </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="phasecontent">
      <p>Our commitment to systems-thinking demands us to investigate root causes.  With this in mind, our interview questions for users are shaped by some foundational questions that we ask ourselves as a team.  </p>

      <ul>
        <li>What is the corner store's relationship with the neighborhood?</li>
        <li>Why are corner stores inherently pedestrian-friendly?</li>
        <li>How can the store feel more like a neighborhood hub rather than strictly a place for commercial transactions?</li>
        <li>What drives the high prices at corner stores?</li>
        <li>Do residents have promising career opportunities at local corner stores?</li>
        <li>Would storeowners consider cooperative ownership models?</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
        - Can nearby corner stores collaborate to be more profitable? Are they willing to work together if they collectively benefit?
        - Are owners and employees of corner stores residents of the communities they serve? If not, how can this be encouraged?
        - If stores were stocked with healthy foods, would kids truly pick apples over candy bars? Why/not?
        - What systems would prevent a portion of store profits from going back into institutions in the immediate area?
        - Which initiatives have succeeded? To what degree? By whose standards? Why/not?
        - Which incentives need to be reversed? Which ones result in illogical outcomes? -->

      <h3>Give your Perspective</h3>
      <p>If you are a corner store manager, a resident, or a small farmer and want to see this happen, please <a href="https://resus.typeform.com/to/IWDDNk" target="_blank">follow this link</a>.  We'd love to hear your thoughts.  As a thank you, we will enter you into a raffle to win an iPad!</p>


      <h3>Validating Assumptions</h3>
      <p>We conducted user interviews with farmers, producers, and stakeholders to validate our initial assumptions.  Common insights were revealed.  </p>

      <p>Thanks to the many stakeholders who offered their valuable feedback.</p>

        <h4>Target Personas</h4>
          <p>Persona Characteristics</p>
          <p>He has never owned </p>
          <p>For users that want healthier foods but don't have current access, this product puts local, good foods into the corner store closest to them and vets the producers for them.</p>
          <p>For users that want convenient groceries they can walk to, this product puts foods they always buy into the corner store closest to them. </p>
          <p>This product would spark curiosity for shoppers in the corner stores through neighbor recipes, through new produce they are unfamiliar with and inform shoppers of upcoming events where they can learn to cook those new items. </p>
          <p>Users that can't currently afford prices can now inform prices.  </p>

      <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="phasecontent">

      <!-- <p>Prototype the coupon deals and kiosk process.</p>
      <p>Prototype the storage/checkout process with corner store clerks</p>
      <p>Prototype the shipping flow with farmers.</p> -->

      <p>We are honored that a previous version of this project was picked as a finalist for the 2013 Design Ignites Change Professional Fellowship, sponsored by Worldstudio and AIGA. <a href="http://designigniteschange.org/projects/978-community-designed-grocery-store-vision">Click here to see our project featured on their site</a> as well as the other finalists and funded projects! Thanks to the jury for the recongnition. </p>


      <h4>Current Iteration</h4>
      <p>Here are some hi-fi wireframes & diagrams.</p>

      <h4>Future Features to Test</h4>
      <p>Rehab opportunities for corner stores with outstanding performance.  Those rehab opportunities being tied to local C&D firms that do job training and hiring.  Those trainees and hires being offered housing options within walking distance.</p>
      <p>Member-ownership options for residents.</p>
      <p>Worker-ownership options for employees.</p>
      <p>Partnership with schools and neighborhood markets for cooking demos, etc.</p>

      <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="phasecontent">
      <p>Sales of Item X meet or exceed number necessary for supplier to turn a profit.</p>
      <p>Each corner store in program decides to "convert" a new item every month.</p>
      <p>User acquisition increases steadily. </p>
