  <h1>Achieving the American Dream through Co-ops</h1>

  <h3>Reaching Equity</h3>
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="equity" -->
<p>We are living in a society that champions home ownership but offers only one main route to get there. And for the majority - it's unaffordable.</p>
<p>Cooperatives allow its members to invest in property affordably and to, when desired, have real, human interaction with neighbors amidst a world of isolation and digital distraction.</p>

    <h2>Reframing Co-ops to Address Current Housing Issues</h2>

<p>The co-op movement needs a contemporary nudge.  A design touch?  A hip angle? We are proposing a more proactive, design-focused campaign that embraces other relevant sectors - including affordable housing, community & economic development, policy, real estate, design and technology.  It needs a marketing strategy and tools to make it easier for people to start exploring.  <a href="#benefits"><strong>Read more</strong></a> about the little-known benefits of housing co-ops. </p>

<h2>What We Are Doing to Reframe</h2>
<p>Our contribution includes a number of initiatives:
  <ul>
    <li>Creating <strong>personalized vision boards</strong> to envision basic goals (<a href="#visionboards">see below</a>)</li>
    <li>Creating <strong>visual diagrams</strong> to illustrate the process, making it easier to understand (see below)</li>
    <li>Maintaining a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Housing-Cooperative-Potentials/420807511344699"><strong>facebook group</strong></a> that curates related articles/events and allows people to connect</li>
    <li>Providing <strong>custom design services</strong> for co-op units, using a competitive bid process to lower costs</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h2>But Our Proudest Achievement?  ... <a href="http://fireplace.resusstudio.com">Fireplace</a>: a tool that factors in your friends and presents the necessary context</h2>
<h3>Initial Observations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We found that once stereotypes are broken down, most people ARE interested in cooperatives.</li>
  <li>Unlike homeownership, there is rarely enough information to decide whether co-ops are a good fit.  It involves too many extra factors - not only the values, living preferences and finances of individuals, but also the group's.  </li>
  <li>Without the context presented, it is very difficult to make an informed decision.  Yet this is a necessary step before planning even begins! </li>
</ul>

<h3>Check out our featured proposal:</br><a href="http://fireplace.resusstudio.com">FIREPLACE</a> makes exploring co-ops as easy as deciding to buy a home</h3>

</div>

<p>We want to emphasize that this is only one tool that for full effectiveness, should be applied in parallel with many other approaches and an overall strategy. </p>

<h2><a name="benefits"></a>Busting Stereotypes Surrounding Co-ops</h2>
<p>Cooperative housing is an affordable housing option that is not well-known and shrouded in myths. In fact, it is a model that allows you to own/invest in more than a home.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have as much privacy as a typical apartment/condo unit.</li>
    <li>Own property when you don't qualify for traditional financing.</li>
    <li>Live in a unit without neighbors that bug you.</li>
    <li>Own property with a close-knit group of friends rather than a condo association.</li>
    <li>Customize your unit without worrying about a landlord.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="visionboards"></a>Personalized Vision Boards</h2>

<p>A vision board is a good starting point to get your unique vision out of your head and onto paper. This is useful to show potential co-op members to immediately see which values/goals are shared. </p>

  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="QsandPartners" -->
  <h3>Powerful Questions</h3>
  <ul>
<li>How can we show the wide spectrum of cooperative living options that exist?</li>
<li>Why should condo owners or homeowners consider switching to cooperative ownership?</li>
<li>What kinds of financing options do cooperatives offer?</li>
<li>How can housing cooperatives be branded to appeal to a wider audience?</li>
<li>Which obstacles are in place that make the cooperative housing process difficult? Why?</li>
<li>What incentives exist for other industries to embrace cooperative ownership? Which ones need to be shifted for it to become a mainstream option?</li>
<li>Can cooperative ownership positively reform the development world? </li>
