  <h1>Achieving the American Dream through Co-ops</h1>

	  <h3>Reaching Equity</h3>
	  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="equity" -->
		<p>We are living in a society that champions home ownership but offers only one main route to get there. And for the majority - it's unaffordable.</p>
		<p>Cooperatives allow its members to invest in property affordably and to, when desired, have real, human interaction with neighbors amidst a world of isolation and digital distraction.</p>

	  <h2>We Create Tools to Better Understand the Idea & Process behind Forming Housing Cooperatives</h2>

		<p>We believe housing co-ops have the power to address serious housing issues we're facing as a culture.  But the co-op movement needs a contemporary nudge.  A design touch?  A hip angle? We are proposing a more proactive, design-focused campaign that embraces other relevant sectors - including affordable housing, community & economic development, policy, real estate, and technology.  It needs a marketing strategy and tools to make it easier for people to start exploring. </p>
		<p>We hope some of the these tools will help you in exploring housing co-ops!  </p>

		<p>If it's more your style, you can stay updated through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/housingchicago/" target="_blank">Facebook (@housingchicago)</a> or our <a href="http://eepurl.com/cmiuZv" target="_blank">Good Housing newsletter</a>.</p>

		<!-- <h2>But Our Proudest Achievement?  ... <a href="http://fireplace.resusstudio.com">Fireplace</a>: a tool that factors in your friends and presents the necessary context</h2>
		<h3>Initial Observations</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>We found that once stereotypes are broken down, most people ARE interested in cooperatives.</li>
		  <li>Unlike homeownership, there is rarely enough information to decide whether co-ops are a good fit.  It involves too many extra factors - not only the values, living preferences and finances of individuals, but also the group's.  </li>
		  <li>Without the context presented, it is very difficult to make an informed decision.  Yet this is a necessary step before planning even begins! </li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="benefits"></a>Breaking Stereotypes: Co-ops are Probably Not What You Think</h2>
		<p>Cooperative housing is an affordable housing option that is not well-known and shrouded in myths. In fact, it is a model that allows you to own/invest in more than a home.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Have as much privacy as a typical apartment/condo unit.</li>
		    <li>Own property when you don't qualify for traditional financing.</li>
		    <li>Live in a unit without neighbors that bug you.</li>
		    <li>Own property with a close-knit group of friends rather than a condo association.</li>
		    <li>Customize your unit without worrying about a landlord.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Group Compatability Tool</h2>
		<p><strong><a href="http://fireplace.resusstudio.com" target="_blank">Fireplace</a></strong> is a tool we're developing to help groups of people evaluate their own group of people.  It makes the daunting process of involving others easier by understanding important information about each other from the beginning. <strong><a href="http://fireplace.resusstudio.com" target="_blank">Sign up for updates or become a beta tester!</a></strong></p>


		<h2><a name="visionboards"></a>Personalized Vision Boards</h2>

			<p>A vision board is a good starting point to get your unique vision out of your head and onto paper. This is useful to show potential co-op members to immediately see which values/goals are shared. If you need help, this is a service we offer! </p>

		<h2>Other Efforts to Reframe</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li>More and more <strong>visual diagrams</strong> to illustrate the process, making it easier to understand.</li>
		    <li>Maintaining a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Housing-Cooperative-Potentials/420807511344699"><strong>facebook group</strong></a> that curates related articles/events and allows people to connect.</li>
		    <li>Providing <strong>custom design services</strong> for co-op units, using a competitive bid process to lower costs.</li>
				<li>Refreshing the design for the <a href="http://www.chicagocoop.net" target="_blank">Cooperative Communities of Chicago</a> website with a user-centered focus.  </li>
