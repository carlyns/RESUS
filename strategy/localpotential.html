      <!-- include context, don't suggest a solution, include a metric to improve -->
      <p>There are high concentrations of skilled and passionate people in every neighborhood, ready to learn, collaborate, lead, and give back to their community.  Yet most opportunities for innovation and networking take place in high-income neighborhoods.

				<h2>Proposal</h2>
			</div>

		<div class="phasecontent">
			<p>We want to take advantage of the unique and plentiful ideas, industries, interests of a neighborhood.  Taking stock of these will help build a community-driven mechanism to increase local self-reliance, one neighborhood at a time.</p>

			<p>We're proposing a website with a survey, profile, map, and resources allows anyone to pursue hobbies, form a business, or launch an idea -- with neighbors! </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="phasecontent">


      <p>Our commitment to systems-thinking demands us to investigate root causes.  With this in mind, our interview questions for users are shaped by some foundational questions that we ask ourselves as a team.  </p>

		  <ul>
				<li>How can we highlight the skills of the underemployed and unemployed?</li>
				<li>Are there businesses primed to startup among hyperlocal neighbors?</li>
				<li>Are local skills a source of community pride?</li>
				<li>Does this data exist already but in another form?</li>
				<li>Are neighbors curious about which other neighbors share their industry/skills?</li>
				<li>Would residents prefer continuing their profession, but working closer to home?  Why?</li>
				<li>How many residents are itching to execute an idea/project?</li>
				<li>Are residents looking for collaborators?</li>
				<li>Are residents looking for meeting space?  For what activities?  </li>



				<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
			  -->
		  </ul>





			<!-- <h3>Context</h3>


			<h3>Validating Assumptions</h3>
				<p>We conducted user interviews with residents, workforce agencies, neighborhood organizations, and service providers to validate our initial assumptions. </p>

				<p>Thanks to the many stakeholders who offered their valuable feedback.</p>

      <!-- <h4>Previous Iterations</h4> -->

			<h3>Current Iteration</h3>

			<!-- dream team-up local -->

			<p>There is a lot of potential among the unemployed and underemployed.</p>

			<p>This tool takes an inventory of your local neighborhood's ideas, interests, and industries. It displays it on a map so you can see who wants to do what near you.</p>

			<!-- what makes this website the go-to site, and not additive (split the vote). link to facebook? how do you make it ubiquitous? easy to use, actionable items, lots of partners? -->

			<p>A component of using existing buildings as a space for classes and meetings for groups that decide to go forward together.  This can be linked back to the <a href="../publicschools.html">Multi-Use Schools proposal</a>.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Do you have neighbors that share your industry? What if you team up to start your own business walking distance from your home?</li>
				<li>Do you want to learn a new hobby but all the meetups happen in an incovenient area?</li>
				<li>Do need a team to launch your idea, but potential team members live far away and you can't coordinate meetings?</li>
				<li>Do you know of a need in your neighborhood but can't start a campaign yourself?</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>How would (personas) use this program? </h4>
			<p>This will spark people to form hobby groups, startup companies, new local businesses.</p>

			<p>This data can also be used by job training programs to focus their attention to areas or industries.</p>

			<p>Institutions can add to this data by showing where their graduates ended up and what their doing. </p>
