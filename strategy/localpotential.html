<h2>proposal: neighbors startup network // lightbulb
</h2>
A website with a survey, profile, map, and resources allows anyone to pursue your hobbies, form a business, or launch your idea -- with your neighbors!
<div class="projectimg">
  <img src="../strategy/localpotential/nsnwireframe.png" alt="balsalmiq wireframe">
</div>

what makes this website the go-to site, and not additive (split the vote). link to facebook? how do you make it ubiquitous? easy to use, actionable items, lots of partners?

<h2>dream team-up local
</h2>
There is a lot of potential among the unemployed and underemployed.



This tool takes an inventory of your local neighborhood's ideas, interests, industries, and passions. It displays it on a map so you can see who wants to do what near you.

This will spark people to form hobby groups, startup companies, new local businesses.

This data can also be used by job training programs to focus their attention to areas or industries.

Institutions can add to this data by showing where their graduates ended up and what their doing. (But this isn't necessarily what they WANT to do)

<h2>Multi-Use Schools
</h2>

A component of using existing buildings as a space for classes and meetings for groups that decide to go forward together.  This can be linked back to the <a href="../publicschools.html">original proposal</a>.

  <h3>Powerful Questions</h3>
  <ul>
pooling human potential
support of new startups
new sense of local identity
unique piece of data
Do you have neighbors that share your industry? What if you team up to start your own business walking distance from your home?
Do you want to learn a new hobby but all the meetups happen in an incovenient area?
Do need a team to launch your idea, but potential team members live far away and you can't coordinate meetings?
Do you know of a need in your neighborhood but can't start a campaign yourself?

<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
    - Can nearby corner stores collaborate to be more profitable? Are they willing to work together if they collectively benefit?
    - Are owners and employees of corner stores residents of the communities they serve? If not, how can this be encouraged?
    - If stores were stocked with healthy foods, would kids truly pick apples over candy bars? Why/not?
    - What systems would prevent a portion of store profits from going back into institutions in the immediate area?
    - Which initiatives have succeeded? To what degree? By whose standards? Why/not?
    - Which incentives need to be reversed? Which ones result in illogical outcomes? -->
