      <!-- include context, don't suggest a solution, include a metric to improve -->
      <p>Neighborhoods are some of our proudest city assets. Yet their borders can be used to do more harm than good. Gerrymandering is used for political gain.  Globally, countries and their political borders often create division rather than healthy nationalism.  <span style="font-weight: 800;">This project aims to show that most borders don't make much sense when it comes to community identity.</span></p>

        <h2>Proposal</h2>
      </div>

    <div class="phasecontent">


      <p>This project asks Chicagoans to draw the edges of a neighborhood they know well.</p>

      <p>We visually show how realistically blurred the boundaries really are. Nothing is black & white and there are no wrong answers. We present the latest visuals here and on <a href="http://borderblur.tumblr.com">borderblur.tumblr.com</a></p>

      <p>Chicago is proud of being a "city of neighborhoods." But everyone has different definitions of where their beloved neighborhood begins and ends.
      </p>
      <p>Some neighborhoods are called different names by different people. And the City of Chicago doesn't even recognize some of our favorite neighborhoods as official community areas.
      Our ward boundaries don't do the greatest job representing its citizens. Neither do our congressional districts.
      </p>
      <p>We want to know - what is YOUR definition of your Chicago neighborhood?

      <h2>Research</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="phasecontent">
      <p>Our commitment to systems-thinking demands us to investigate root causes.  With this in mind, our interview questions for users are shaped by some foundational questions that we ask ourselves as a team.  </p>

      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Political borders are important for administration, but how can they better reflect changing communities and demographics?</li>
          <li>How can we better define our neighborhoods to encourage flow between them to share our cultures?</li>
          <li>Borders help us locate ourselves in the city and rally in neighborhood pride - so can they be more inclusive at the time?</li>

      <!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...  -->

      </ul>


      <h3>Give your Perspective</h3>
      <p>If you are a corner store manager, a resident, or a small farmer and want to see this happen, please <a href="https://resus.typeform.com/to/IWDDNk" target="_blank">follow this link</a>.  We'd love to hear your thoughts.  As a thank you, we will enter you into a raffle to win an iPad!</p>


      <h3>Validating Assumptions</h3>
      <p>We conducted user interviews with farmers, producers, and stakeholders to validate our initial assumptions.  Common insights were revealed.  </p>



      <h4>Users</h4>
      <p>After conducting interviews, farmers and producers (Pleasant House, City Market) say that transit costs are the worst.  </p>
      <p>Assumption validated.  People interviewed do want healthy food.  The prices are just too high.  </p>
      <p>Assumption validated.  People can't afford the high prices.</p>

      <!-- BLOCK QUOTES MIGHT WORK WELL HERE AS HIGHLIGHTS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SKIM -->

      <h4>Stakeholder Input</h4>
      <!-- <ul>
        CORE77
        Chicago Dept of Cultural Affairs
        IL Humanities Council
      </ul>  -->


      <h4>Target Personas</h4>
      <p>How would they use this program? </p>
      <p>For users that want convenient groceries they can walk to, this product puts foods they always buy into the corner store closest to them. </p>
      <p>Users that can't currently afford prices can now inform prices.  </p>
