  <h1>Equitable Transit Options</h1>


<div class="equity">
  <h3>Reaching Equity</h3>
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="equity" -->
<p>Chicago's transit system is not equitable.
</p>
<p>Infrastructural improvements and maintenance favor areas of the city more frequented by tourists.
</p>
<p>New train lines should only be planned if improving the bus system and fixing the transit card system are addressed at the very same time.
</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>This map mimics a "heat map" showing areas of the city serviced by train stations and/or train lines within a 1/2-mile (the maximum reasonable walking distance is about 12 min). The more intense the color, the more train station/line options there are to choose from.
</p>
<p>The bus lines are underlaid to show "cool" zones, or areas which are only serviced by buses, if at all.
</p>

</div>

<div class="caption">We plan to add a layer showing population density coded by income levels, highlighting specific income levels within the transit option radii.
</div>

<p>A person unfamiliar with Chicago would assume from this transit system that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most activity in the city occurs in the loop.</li>
<li>Bus connections are efficient/adequate & pleasant to transport people in "cool" zones to train stations.</li>
<li>There are more options for those who don't own a car.</li>
</ul>
<p>These assumptions are inaccurate to various degrees.
</p>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>For a more equitable transit system, we recommend:
</p>

<ol><li>Creating pedestrian-friendly and retail-dense corridors between areas where there is only one train line/station option.</li>
<li>Prioritizing bus service maintenance, technology and design for the "cool" zones which are completely reliant on buses.</li>
<li>Planning new lines/stations/economic development for low-income areas that need more overall activity.</li></ol>

<div class="questions">
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="QsandPartners" -->
  <h3>Powerful Questions</h3>
  <ul>
<li>Shouldn't those with lower incomes have MORE transit options, since they are less likely to own a car?</li>
<li>If an area is only served by buses, shouldn't maintenance and beautification be focused there?</li>
<li>Aren't corridors between stations an easy target for business corridor/economic development?</li>
<li>While transit access in denser areas makes sense, wouldn't access in other areas catalyze density where it's needed most? </li>

<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
    - Can nearby corner stores collaborate to be more profitable? Are they willing to work together if they collectively benefit?
    - Are owners and employees of corner stores residents of the communities they serve? If not, how can this be encouraged?
    - If stores were stocked with healthy foods, would kids truly pick apples over candy bars? Why/not?
    - What systems would prevent a portion of store profits from going back into institutions in the immediate area?
    - Which initiatives have succeeded? To what degree? By whose standards? Why/not?
    - Which incentives need to be reversed? Which ones result in illogical outcomes? -->

      <p>We are partnering with the municipality of Holland to implement zoning policies in line with our proposal - putting residential only on once side of a corridor, allowing construction on top of and in the parking lots of strip malls and box stores.</p>
