  <h3>Reaching Equity</h3>
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="equity" -->
<p>Despite our love for cities, we cannot forget about the suburbs.</p>
<p>With more of our nation's poor being driven to the suburbs, we need to focus on a new model that encourages human connection, vitality and culture - not sameness, conformity or convention.</p>

    <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="proposal" -->
<p>The suburbs were designed for the car, not the human being. As a result, the physical development of suburban commercial areas bear a striking resemblance across the country. When the idea of "walking around" is unheard of in the suburbs, something needs to change. </p>

<div class="projectimg">
  <img src="../strategy/suburbia/typcommcorr1.png" alt="typical corridor illustrations">
</div>

<p>Simple shifts can encourage suburban development that's less isolating, less car-dependent, and values human dignity. Instead of traffic being a measure of vitality, the visible measurement is human activity.</p>

<div class="projectimg">

</div>

<h2>The Proposal</h2>
  <p> By using human-scaled values as the foundation for a new development framework, the next generation of robust suburbs will evolve.</p>

  <h3>Key Components:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>More people per square mile, in places that make sense.</li>
      <li>Proud existing residents and local businesses can show their commitment to their town through investment and ownership opportunities.</li>
      <li>Outside companies or prospective residents have a simple process to invest in property and employees, with clear rewards.</li>
      <li>Location of amenities close enough to get around.</li>
    </ul>


<h3>OPPORTUNITY CORES:</h3>
<p>Create zones with irresistible jobs and opportunities for locals. Allow zone to expand with the same density of opportunities. </p>

<div class="questions">
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="QsandPartners" -->
  <h3>Powerful Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How can we prioritize humans over cars in the suburbs?</li>
    <li>Can preferences for size and space compete with walkability?</li>
    <li>When will the sense of human-scaled vitality/activity outweigh the comfort of one's own vehicle?</li>
    <li>How can we make the business opportunity irresistible to companies looking to invest?</li>
    <li>How can we make the change most seamless for residents? How can we reward residents for coping with the change?</li>

<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
    - Can nearby corner stores collaborate to be more profitable? Are they willing to work together if they collectively benefit?
    - Are owners and employees of corner stores residents of the communities they serve? If not, how can this be encouraged?
    - If stores were stocked with healthy foods, would kids truly pick apples over candy bars? Why/not?
    - What systems would prevent a portion of store profits from going back into institutions in the immediate area?
    - Which initiatives have succeeded? To what degree? By whose standards? Why/not?
    - Which incentives need to be reversed? Which ones result in illogical outcomes? -->

    <h3>Project News</h3>
      <p>We are partnering with the municipality of Holland to implement zoning policies in line with our proposal - putting residential only on once side of a corridor, allowing construction on top of and in the parking lots of strip malls and box stores.</p>
