      <!-- include context, don't suggest a solution, include a metric to improve -->
      <p>Despite our love for cities, we cannot forget about the suburbs.  The suburbs have been always been home to a massive population that not only supports our cities but themselves.  More of our nation's poor are being driven to the suburbs as urban housing prices rise.

		<div class="phasecontent">

			<p>By using human-scaled values as the foundation for a new development framework, the next generation of robust suburbs will evolve.</p>

		  <p>Key components would include</p>
		    <ul>
		      <li>More people per square mile, in places that make sense.</li>
		      <li>Proud existing residents and local businesses can show their commitment to their town through investment and ownership opportunities.</li>
		      <li>Outside companies or prospective residents have a simple process to invest in property and employees, with clear rewards.</li>
		      <li>Location of amenities close enough to get around.</li>
		    </ul>


			<p>"Opportunity cores" would contain employment, services, and amenities for locals. These zones could expand maintaining the same density of opportunities. </p> -->

      <h2>Research</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="phasecontent">

      <p>Our commitment to systems-thinking demands us to investigate root causes.  With this in mind, our interview questions for users are shaped by some foundational questions that we ask ourselves as a team.  </p>

		  <ul>
				<li>How can we prioritize humans over cars in the suburbs?</li>
		    <li>Can preferences for size and space compete with walkability?</li>
		    <li>When will the sense of human-scaled vitality/activity outweigh the comfort of one's own vehicle?</li>
		    <li>How can we make the business opportunity irresistible to companies looking to invest?</li>
		    <li>How can we make the change most seamless for residents? How can we reward residents for coping with the change?</li>
				<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
			  -->
		  </ul>





			<h3>Context</h3>

			<p>The suburbs were designed for the car, not the human being. As a result, the physical development of suburban commercial areas bear a striking resemblance across the country. When the idea of "walking around" is unheard of in the suburbs, something needs to change. </p>

			<div class="projectimg">
			<img src="../strategy/suburbia/typcommcorr1.png" alt="typical corridor illustrations">
			</div>

			<p>Simple shifts can encourage suburban development that's less isolating, less car-dependent, and values human dignity. Instead of traffic being a measure of vitality, the visible measurement is human activity.</p>

			<h4>We are currently in the Research Phase of this project.</h4>

			<!-- <h3>Validating Assumptions</h3>
				<p>We conducted user interviews with residents, businesses, and service providers to validate our initial assumptions. </p> -->

				<!-- <p>Thanks to the many stakeholders who offered their valuable feedback.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>CNT</li>
						<li>Alex MacLean</li>
						<li>Ellen DJ</li>
						Confronting Suburban Poverty
						SSMMA
						City of Holland, Michigan
					</ul> -->

			<!--<h4>Common User Insights</h4>
        <p>After conducting interviews, residents and local small business owners are nostalgic of the bustling commercial corridors from decades ago.  They have confidence that their neighborhood can sustain a local economy if the correct framework is laid out.  </p>
        <p>We also validated that waiting for the bus is unpleasant.  </p>
        <p>Assumption validated.  Even if they own a cell phone, users don't want to bother checking it for the bus. Other users don't want to check their mobile device because it's too much of a cost with their data plan. </p>
        <p>Assumption validated.  Residents want to learn more about their local businesses.  Some are even embarrassed to go inside. </p>
        <p>Residents who prefer taking the bus to the train like taking it because it's safer and it's closer.  They take these qualities over speed.  Most of these users are female.</p>
        <p>Small business owners are looking for more analog methods of connecting with customers. They prefer customers that live in the neighborhood because they are more likely to become recurring customers. </p> -->

<!--
      <p>Based on our research, we brainstormed numerous ideas/features for our proposed solution.  They ranged from transit incentives to employer-assisted housing.  </p>
      <p>The design direction we took prioritized features that reimagined and reused typical suburban land-use patterns.  We also prioritied features that encouraged walkability and less dependence on cars for hyperlocal residents.  </p>

<!--
			<h3>Current Iteration</h3>
			<h4>What the hell is the small slice MVP?? </h4>
			<p>shuttle, business owner survey if they'd relocate?  do an inventory of potential properties to rehab/relocate and gauge interest among businesses?  same thing with residential properties?  do pop-up shops first?  do micro retail first?</p>
			<p>funrise-type kickstarter campaign for property?</p>
			<p>pay lyft drivers in the area to do pickups for free</p>
			<p>need workforce component also.  apprenticeships at microretail?  co-op opps?</p>

			<p>
				Add some of the in-progress sketches / cartoon gifs here.
			</p> -->

			<!-- <h4>How would (personas) use this program? </h4>
			<p>
				Local residents can take a shuttle to their local opportunity core.
			</p>
			<p>Businesses have the option to rehab and/or expand their business.</p>
			<p>Transit providers have guaranteed ridership. </p>
			<p>Social service providers will see participation increase.  </p>	-->
