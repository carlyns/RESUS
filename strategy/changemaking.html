    </div>

		<div class="phasecontent">
      <!-- include context, don't suggest a solution, include a metric to improve -->
			<p>We all want to live meaningful lives. Most of us want equity, however you define it. At the same time, the words "social impact" and "innovation" are being thrown around a lot these days.
			<span style="font-weight: 800;">How might we better define "changemaking" such that it's not just another piece of jargon?</span></p>

				<h2>Proposal</h2>
			</div>

		<div class="phasecontent">

			<p>With such a new sector, everyone's trying something different - and that's great.  But let's not limit what it could look like.  Let's leave opportunities for new methods to achieve social change.
			</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="phasecontent">

      <p>Our commitment to systems-thinking demands us to investigate root causes.  With this in mind, our interview questions for users are shaped by some foundational questions that we ask ourselves as a team.  </p>

		  <ul>
				<li>Which issues are often addressed? (poverty, corporate greed, human rights, transit ...)</li>
				<li>Who is seen as responsible for making change? (government, nonprofits, activists ...)</li>
				<li>What medium is used? (policy, technology, art, journalism, protest, capitalism ...)</li>
				<li>Which strategies are most effective?  What does "effective" even mean?</li>
				<li>How is impact being measured?  Who is doing the measuring?  Are we learning and improving strategies based on those measurements?  </li>
				<li>What responsibility do funders/philanthropists have to make sure their money is being put to good use and not just being used?  Can reporting requirements become more sophisticated?  </li>
				<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
			  -->
		  </ul>





			<h3>Context</h3>

			<p>We consider ourselves here at RESUSstudio active participants in the social impact world, but there is never a straightforward answer to what "changemaking" really is. For true progress to occur, we think it's important to encourage this discussion.

			<!-- <h3>Validating Assumptions</h3>
				<p>We conducted user interviews with residents, schools, and service providers to validate our initial assumptions. </p> -->

						Impact Engine
						EPIC
						Public Good
						Chicago Action Brunch
						Chicago Social Innovators
						Chicago OpenIDEO

      <h2>Prioritization</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="phasecontent">
			<!-- Describe the MVP / small slice version
			Describe how we whittled down features to get to this MVP -->

      <p>Based on our research, we brainstormed numerous ideas/features for our proposed solution.  They ranged from producing a toolkit to visually diagramming case studies.  </p>
      <p>The design direction we took prioritized anecdotal accounts.  </p>

			<!-- <p>After weighing effort and impact, we devised a small slice of our solution to test. </p> -->

      <!-- <h4>Previous Iterations</h4> -->


			<!-- <h3>Current Iteration</h3> -->

			<p>We see this project taking various forms. First up: people profiles! We are having changemaking chats and starting local, in our homebase of Chicago.
			</p>
			<p>No matter who you are or what you do, eventually it crosses all of our minds, even if for a second: "Why was I put on this earth, and how can I make the most of it?"
			</p>
			<p>This question can be both motivating and frightening.
			</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>Are we doing our part by raising a well-rounded child in a loving family?</li>
			    <li>By regularly volunteering for a cause that interests you?</li>
			    <li>By offering your skills to help tackle a social issue?</li>
			    <li>Or simply by living your life as an upstanding citizen of the world?</li>
			  </ul>

			<p>We want to explore what changemaking means to different people from different backgrounds. </p>

			<p>Here's our first installment:
