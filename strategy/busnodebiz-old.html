  <h3>Reaching Equity</h3>
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="equity" -->
    <p>Riding and waiting for the bus is disproportionately more unpleasant in Chicago's neglected neighborhoods. Ironically, this is exactly where bus routes trace former bustling corridors on the west and south sides.</p>
    <p>A bus tracker could be simple catalyst for community self-reliance by connecting residents that wait at bus stops with nearby storefront businesses. </p>

    <h2>The Proposal</h2>
<p>Installing bus trackers in storefronts within a block of a bus stop offers arrival times for peace of mind, provides another option for shelter, and allows residents to interact with neighbor-owned businesses.</p>
<p><a href="#storefronts">Scroll down</a> to participate as a pilot storefront! </p>

<p>While some business storefronts install displays in established neighborhoods, the displays actually act as a catalyst in neglected neighborhoods. </p>


<div class="projectimg">
  <img src="../strategy/busnodebiz/diag-cycle.png" alt="cyclical diagram">
</div>

<p>This simple action can bring neighbor-owned business activity back to these struggling areas and drive residential infill by encouraging community-driven self-reliance.

<div class="questions">
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="QsandPartners" -->
  <h3>Powerful Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How can we provide a more pleasant public transit experience in a distressed physical environment? Are these not the areas where it is most necessary?</li>
    <li>What makes the experience of waiting for a bus tolerable?</li>
    <li>What makes the experience of walking to a bus stop more pleasant in some areas over others?</li>
    <li>What kind of environment provides [the feeling of] safety and shelter?</li>
    <li>How can storeowners connect with locals standing immediately outside?</li>
    <li>What if bus riders don't want to deal with the hassle of looking at their smart phone?</li>
    <li>Are storeowners willing to allow residents to browse their space?</li>
    <li>What are the incentives for browsing in a store and returning in the future?</li>
    <li>What mechanisms can encourage camaraderie over solicitation?</li>

<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
    - Can nearby corner stores collaborate to be more profitable? Are they willing to work together if they collectively benefit?
    - Are owners and employees of corner stores residents of the communities they serve? If not, how can this be encouraged?
    - If stores were stocked with healthy foods, would kids truly pick apples over candy bars? Why/not?
    - What systems would prevent a portion of store profits from going back into institutions in the immediate area?
    - Which initiatives have succeeded? To what degree? By whose standards? Why/not?
    - Which incentives need to be reversed? Which ones result in illogical outcomes? -->
