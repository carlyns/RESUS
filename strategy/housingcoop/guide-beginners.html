				<h3>Get Over the Stereotypes.</h3>

				<p>Co-ops are not communes. And they are not expensive east-coast high-rises. A cooperative is a financial model with shareholders. It can be custom-designed however the members want – single family homes, private apartments, townhomes, communes, and more. As shareholders in that corporation, members have a right to occupy space in the property.</p>

				<p>A good place to stay updated with models that break the mold is our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/goodhousing/" target="_blank">affiliated Facebook page</a> or our <a href="http://eepurl.com/cmiuZv" target="_blank">Good Housing newsletter</a>.</p>

				<h3>Customize to your heart’s content.</h3>

				<p>Given the customization potential of co-ops, the possibilities are endless. Some ideas include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>as much privacy as you want</li>
					<li>architect-designed units</li>
					<li>yard space</li>
					<li>pet-sitters</li>
					<li>car-sharing</li>
					<li>a guest suite</li>
					<li>co-working space</li>
					<li>senior social space</li>
					<li>retail space</li>
					<li>real, live community</li>
				</ul>


				<h3>It’s simply structure.</h3>

				<p>A housing co-op is a corporation that exists primarily to provide housing and related services to its members, and its ownership and governance structure reflect this purpose. — Northcountry Cooperative Foundation’s “Guide for Successful Community Development”</p>

			<div class="stepcontent desktopcontent2">

				<h3>If you can relate to one of the following, a co-op could be <a href="types.png" target="_blank">ideal for you:</a></h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Frustrated with renting.</li>
					<li>Frustrated with owning.</li>
					<li>Dislike your neighbors.</li>
					<li>Can’t get a traditional mortgage.</li>
					<li>Desire to own property but can’t afford it yet.</li>
					<li>Want a support network.</li>
					<li>Want to keep your neighborhood affordable … or keep your rent affordable in a currently gentrifying neighborhood.</li>
					<li>Rather not take part in the housing industry / real-estate market as it operates today.</li>
					<li>Progressive developer who wants to make reliable investments in distressed neighborhoods.</li>
					<li>Want to make your empty lot or vacant property productive again and have it benefit the neighborhood.</li>
				</ul>


				<h3>Use a Compatibility Tool for your Group</h3>

				<p>Make sure you and your group are a good fit for a housing co-op by understanding needs to be considered.  A compatibility tool like <a href="http://fireplace.resusstudio.com" target="_blank">Fireplace</a> walks you through relevant topics (full disclosure: it’s a another project of ours).   It weighs your own living preferences, values, and finances with others and creates a report to better move forward with your group.</p>

				<h2>3. TELL OTHERS</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="stepcontent desktopcontent3">

				<h3>Gauge others’ interest.</h3>

				<p>Mention this idea to others and gauge their interest. You never know, a friend might be thinking about this too. A colleague might have formed one. A family member could use another housing alterative.</p>

				<p>We like to start the conversation with something like, “What’s your current housing situation? Are you happy with it?”</p>

				<p>Feel free to share this guide with your friends or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/goodhousing/" target="_blank">tell them about our Facebook page</a> or to sign up for our <a href="http://eepurl.com/cmiuZv" target="_blank">Good Housing newsletter</a>.</p>


				<p>We're also a fan of the website: <a href="http://www.chicagocoop.net" target="_blank">Cooperative Communities of Chicago</a>.</p>

				<p>You don’t need to have a meetup. Just bring it up in your next conversation – the next time you have lunch or next time you’re in the car with a friend.</p>

				<h3>At this point, keep it casual and fun.</h3>

				<p>Explaining co-ops to newbies can be difficult, but just keep it casual and focus on decent housing. Everyone's values for decent housing is different.  At first, drop a casual mention on social media to your personal or profesional network to test the waters.  You never know who is on the hunt for a better housing situation or shares the same values.  Hobbies or interests can also be a great place to mention housing alternatives, especially if the activity itself shares some of the same values you're looking for in housing (e.g. community, intergenerational living, return on investment, social capital, etc.)  After this inital probe, you should have a good sense of 1) who is willing to put in time and effort to plan, and 2) who is just passively interested, including yourself.</p>

				<p>Be warned: this process can take a long time.  Every group will naturally gain and lose interested parties, but this is an absolutely necessary step.  Don't be discouraged - the deeper you explore, the more people will realize whether it's a good fit for them or not.  This is how you'll end up with a group that can work well together.  </p>

				<h2>4. IT'S COMPLEX</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="stepcontent desktopcontent4">

				<h3>It could get complicated, and that’s ok.</h3>

				<p>Whenever you involve more than one person, things can get complex. Understanding your own finances and preferences is hard enough. Layering those of others on top of yours gets messy.  Even coordinating everyone’s schedule to have a first meeting is a challenge.</p>

				<p>Most of all, co-ops are still rare.  Information is scarce and simple processes (like finding a bank that offers loans to co-ops) are not built up at all.  Being pioneers means added scrutiny, questioning, paperwork, and figuring out many things on your own.</p>

				<p>This <a href="coop-tool context.png" target="_blank">complexity</a> can be daunting … but the customization that emerges from that complexity is also what’s so exciting about co-ops.  Accepting the challenge of exploring co-ops can lead to long-term housing satisfaction.</p>

				<p>In fact, champions willing to take on this challenge are exactly the kind of people we need to help simplify the entire process.  The more demand there is for co-ops, the more accessible its information and infrastructure will become.  You’re making the road easier for others that follow in your footsteps.</p>

				<h2>5. DECIDE</h2>

				<h3>Are you a shopper? Or a creator?</h3>

				<p>Clarifying whether you want to shop around for an existing co-op vacancy or form one on your own is a huge milestone.</p>
				<p class="nouncredit">Icon by Luis Prado via The Noun Project</p>


				<h3>1. Shop Around</h3>

				<p>If you have limited time or energy, connecting with an existing co-op might be a better choice for you. The pool of existing co-ops is not huge, but it’s getting better. And we’re trying to change that with our efforts.</p>

				<p>For now, we recommend subscribing to our <a href="http://eepurl.com/cmiuZv" target="_blank">Good Housing newsletter</a> to get notified of unit vacancies, and doing a basic search on Craigslist or <a href="http://www.ic.org" target="_blank">FIC</a> for cooperatives in your area.</p>

				<p>Also, a future goal of the Fireplace Compatibility Tool (which is currently evaluates compatibility among groups of people) is to match people with existing co-ops. So <a href="http://fireplace.resusstudio.com" target="_blank">start your profile</a> to get notified when this feature is added!</p>
