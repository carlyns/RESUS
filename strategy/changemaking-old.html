  <h1>What is "Changemaking"</h1>


<div class="equity">
  <h3>Reaching Equity</h3>
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="equity" -->
<p>We all want to live meaningful lives. At the same time, the words "social impact" and "innovation" are being thrown around a lot these days. </p>

<p>With such a new sector, everyone's trying something different - and that's great.  But let's not limit what it could look like.  Let's leave opportunities for new methods to achieve social change.
</p>

    <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="proposal" -->
<p>We consider ourselves here at RESUSstudio active participants in the social impact world, but there is never a straightforward answer to what "changemaking" really is. For true progress to occur, we think it's important to encourage this discussion.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which issues are often addressed? (poverty, corporate greed, human rights, transit ...)</li>
  <li>Who is seen as responsible for making change? (government, nonprofits, activists ...)</li>
  <li>What medium is used? (policy, technology, art, journalism, protest, capitalism ...)</li>
  <li>Which strategies are most effective?</li>
</ul>

<h2>People Profiles</h2>

<p>We see this project taking various forms. First up: people profiles! We are having changemaking chats and starting local, in our homebase of Chicago.
</p>
<p>No matter who you are or what you do, eventually it crosses all of our minds, even if for a second: "Why was I put on this earth, and how can I make the most of it?"
</p>
<p>This question can be both motivating and frightening.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are we doing our part by raising a well-rounded child in a loving family?</li>
    <li>By regularly volunteering for a cause that interests you?</li>
    <li>By offering your skills to help tackle a social issue?</li>
    <li>Or simply by living your life as an upstanding citizen of the world?</li>
  </ul>

<p>We want to explore what changemaking means to different people from different backgrounds. </p>

<p>Here's our first installment:

<div class="questions">
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="QsandPartners" -->
  <h3>Powerful Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Can those "making change" collaborate more? Do they work together now? How?</li>
    <li>Who is best equipped to make change?</li>
    <li>Why does it seem like progress isn't being made? Or does it? Should you be able to feel social "progress" as an individual?</li>
    <li>What are meaningful ways to measure impact?</li>
    <li>What are ways you detect social progress as an individual? How SHOULD social progress affect you?</li>
    <li>Should all well-intentioned ideas be funded? </li>


<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
    - Can nearby corner stores collaborate to be more profitable? Are they willing to work together if they collectively benefit?
    - Are owners and employees of corner stores residents of the communities they serve? If not, how can this be encouraged?
    - If stores were stocked with healthy foods, would kids truly pick apples over candy bars? Why/not?
    - What systems would prevent a portion of store profits from going back into institutions in the immediate area?
    - Which initiatives have succeeded? To what degree? By whose standards? Why/not?
    - Which incentives need to be reversed? Which ones result in illogical outcomes? -->

    <h3>Project News</h3>
      <p>We are partnering with the municipality of Holland to implement zoning policies in line with our proposal - putting residential only on once side of a corridor, allowing construction on top of and in the parking lots of strip malls and box stores.</p>
