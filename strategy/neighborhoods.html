  <h3>Reaching Equity</h3>
  <!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="equity" -->
<p>Neighborhoods are some of our proudest city assets. Yet their borders can be used to do more harm than good. Gerrymandering is used for political gain.</p>

<p>Globally, countries and their political borders often create division rather than healthy nationalism.</p>

<p>This project aims to show that most borders don't make much sense when it comes to community identity.</p>

<p>This project asks Chicagoans to draw the edges of a neighborhood they know well.</p>

<p>We visually show how realistically blurred the boundaries really are. Nothing is black & white and there are no wrong answers. We present the latest visuals here and on <a href="http://borderblur.tumblr.com">borderblur.tumblr.com</a></p>

<p>Chicago is proud of being a "city of neighborhoods." But everyone has different definitions of where their beloved neighborhood begins and ends.
</p>
<p>Some neighborhoods are called different names by different people. And the City of Chicago doesn't even recognize some of our favorite neighborhoods as official community areas.
Our ward boundaries don't do the greatest job representing its citizens. Neither do our congressional districts.
</p>
<p>We want to know - what is YOUR definition of your Chicago neighborhood?
If you haven't contributed your map yet, check out our <a href="http://twitter.com/resusstudio">twitter feed @RESUSstudio</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/RESUSstudio">follow us on facebook</a> to find out where we'll be next!

  <h3>Powerful Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Political borders are important for administration, but how can they better reflect changing communities and demographics?</li>
    <li>How can we better define our neighborhoods to encourage flow between them to share our cultures?</li>
    <li>Borders help us locate ourselves in the city and rally in neighborhood pride - so can they be more inclusive at the time?</li>

<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...
    - Can nearby corner stores collaborate to be more profitable? Are they willing to work together if they collectively benefit?
    - Are owners and employees of corner stores residents of the communities they serve? If not, how can this be encouraged?
    - If stores were stocked with healthy foods, would kids truly pick apples over candy bars? Why/not?
    - What systems would prevent a portion of store profits from going back into institutions in the immediate area?
    - Which initiatives have succeeded? To what degree? By whose standards? Why/not?
    - Which incentives need to be reversed? Which ones result in illogical outcomes? -->
