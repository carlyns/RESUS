		<div class="phasecontent">
      <!-- include context, don't suggest a solution, include a metric to improve -->
      <p>Public schools in Chicago are being closed in large numbers after being labelled "underutilized."  Meanwhile, Chicago residents need more community hubs.  Public schools are meant to be a public service for all.  Their buildings hold significant historic value, and they are conveniently well-distributed throughout residential areas.
			<span style="font-weight: 800;">How might we better utilize public school infrastructure to serve more local residents?</span></p>

				<h2>Proposal</h2>
			</div>

		<div class="phasecontent">


			<p>Since public schools are meant to serve students equally city-wide, instead of demolishing them, we should be finding ways to improve them. Once reprogrammed with resources and training for both children and adults, a regular farmer's market, community activities, and a variety of social services, public schools can transform into hubs of genuine public service and community. </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="phasecontent">
      <p>Our commitment to systems-thinking demands us to investigate root causes.  With this in mind, our interview questions for users are shaped by some foundational questions that we ask ourselves as a team.  </p>

		  <ul>
		    <li>How can these high-quality historic school buildings be reused?</li>
		    <li>How can we take advantage of the walkability of elementary schools throughout residential areas?</li>
		    <li>How can the school schedule be adjusted to accomodate the larger community activities?</li>

				<!--TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS ...

			<p>We sought to deeply understand the relationship public schools currently have with nearby residents.  We wanted to know how residents interacted with their neighborhood school with or without kids.  </p>

			<p>We learned from schools that have existing programs in place for residents and similarly, from the organizations that offer their programs through the schools.  </p>

			<p>This intervention recognizes that existing public school buildings are both beautiful and accessibly dispersed (within walking distance of most Chicagoan's homes) almost perfectly throughout residential neighborhoods.

    <div class="phasecontent">
      <p>Based on our research, we brainstormed numerous ideas/features for our proposed solution.  They ranged from converting abandon school buildings into vertical farms to co-working spaces empty classrooms.  </p>
      <p>We wanted to prioritize features that utilized the expertise of service partners, like after school programs, social services, and food distributors.  </p>

		<div class="phasecontent">
			<p>After weighing effort and impact, we devised small slices of our solution to test. </p>

      <h4>Iteration 0.1</h4>
			<p>Our entry for <a href="http://www.designmakeschange.com/dmc_SHC.html" target="_blank"> Design Makes Change</a>'s Sweet Homes Chicago 2012 competition won 1st place! Many thanks to the organizers, jurors, and supporters.</p>

			<h4>Iteration 0.2</h4>
			<p>We tested the change in engagement when we marketed certain programs to the neighborhood.</p>
			<p>We gathered information about which programs were the most popular. </p>
			<p>We measured the interest in relocating programs to closer public schools. </p>


			<h4>Current Iteration</h4>
