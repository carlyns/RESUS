    </div>

		<div class="phasecontent">
      <!-- include context, don't suggest a solution, include a metric to improve -->
      <p>Public schools in Chicago are being closed in large numbers after being labelled "underutilized."  Meanwhile, Chicago residents need more community hubs.  Public schools are meant to be a public service for all.  Their buildings hold significant historic value, and they are conveniently well-distributed throughout residential areas.
			<span style="font-weight: 800;">How might we better utilize public school infrastructure to serve more local residents?</span></p>

				<h2>Proposal</h2>
			</div>

		<div class="phasecontent">


			<p>Since public schools are meant to serve students equally city-wide, instead of demolishing them, we should be finding ways to improve them. Once reprogrammed with resources and training for both children and adults, a regular farmer's market, community activities, and a variety of social services, public schools can transform into hubs of genuine public service and community. </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="phasecontent">


      <p>Our commitment to systems-thinking demands us to investigate root causes.  With this in mind, our interview questions for users are shaped by some foundational questions that we ask ourselves as a team.  </p>

		  <ul>
				<li>How can we take advantage of the walkability of elementary schools throughout residential areas?</li>
				<li>How do nearby residents currently interact with their closest public elementary school, with or without kids?</li>
				<li>Which existing programs/services do public schools offer residents?  What are the challenges they face?  </li>
		    <li>How can high-quality historic school buildings be reused?</li>
		    <li>How can the school schedule be adjusted to accomodate the larger community activities?</li>
		  </ul>



			<h3>Context</h3>

				<p>Historic buildings designed and built with craftsmanship currently suffering from neglect.</p>

					<div class="caption">Chicago public schools in Austin neighborhood, 2012.</div>

				</div>

				<p>This intervention recognizes that existing public school buildings are both beautiful and accessibly dispersed (within walking distance of most Chicagoan's homes) almost perfectly throughout residential neighborhoods.

			<h3>Validating Assumptions</h3>
				<p>We conducted user interviews with residents, schools, and service providers to validate our initial assumptions. </p>

				<p>Thanks to the many stakeholders who offered their valuable feedback.</p>

    <div class="phasecontent">
			<!-- Describe the MVP / small slice version
			Describe how we whittled down features to get to this MVP -->

      <p>Based on our research, we brainstormed numerous ideas/features for our proposed solution.  They ranged from converting abandon school buildings into vertical farms to co-working spaces empty classrooms.  </p>
      <p>The design direction we took prioritized features that capitalized on the expertise of service partners.  This includes social service providers with long-standing experience working with schools,  after-school programs, and neighborhood agencies.  </p>

      <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
    </div>
		<div class="phasecontent">
			<p>After weighing effort and impact, we devised small slices of our solution to test. </p>

      <h4>Previous Iterations</h4>
			<p>Our entry for <a href="http://www.designmakeschange.com/dmc_SHC.html" target="_blank"> Design Makes Change</a>'s Sweet Homes Chicago 2012 competition won 1st place! Many thanks to the organizers, jurors, and supporters.</p>

			<!-- <h3>Current Iteration</h3>
			<p>We are partnering with a pilot school to assess their current programming.  We're continuing our research to identify opportunities for extended programming and outreach to target users in the immediate community.  </p> -->

			<!-- <h4>How would (personas) use this program? </h4> -->

	      <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
	    </div>

	    <div class="phasecontent">
	      <p>Among households without kids, 50% know of one program offered /event hosted at their neighobhrood elementary school and 80% know its name. </p>
	      <p>80% of local residents know where to find event/program information. </p>
	      <p>Program attendance increases by 200%.   </p>

				this is where a tool like 'what is the best way to send you communications' would be useful.

				<p>We tested the change in engagement when we marketed certain programs to the neighborhood.</p>
				<p>We gathered information about which programs were the most popular. </p>
				<p>We measured the interest in relocating programs to closer public schools. </p>
